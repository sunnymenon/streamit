With more bigdata projects being rolledout and cloud enablement in progress
more and more people are tapping the potential capabilities of AWS and other cloud proivers,
large storage availabilities etc.
In this scenario, it is important that tight security be enforced around data that is being provided and exposed
to applications in a cloud environment.
Security is done by two different ways. Both ways assume that data once provided to applications either interanal or external
it is the responsibility of the owner of data to enforce security. Applications will access it either way as provided to them.
